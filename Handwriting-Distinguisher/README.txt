This is the text file containing info on my code 

The title of my project is Handwriting Distinguisher.
Fundamentally, It is a machine learning project that aims to distinguish between different handwriting styles
It does this using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the images of the handwriting samples.
The images are preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and format before being fed into the CNN.
The CNN is trained on a dataset of labeled handwriting samples, allowing it to learn the unique features of each handwriting style.
Once trained, the model can predict the handwriting style of new samples with a high degree of accuracy.
The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for building the CNN, and OpenCV for image preprocessing.
The dataset used is a simple dataset of handwriting samples from me and my siblings. 
Success is defined by the model's ability to distinguish our handwritings from each other with over 90% accuracy.
The project is structured to allow for easy updates and improvements, such as adding more handwriting samples or fine-tuning the CNN architecture.
